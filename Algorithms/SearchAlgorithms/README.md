Search Algorithms
=================
Description
-----------
This repository contains the `C#` implementation of Search Algorithms as follows:

* Simple Linear Search
* Improved Linear Search
* Improved Linear Search with Sentinel
* Binary Search

Additionally, the Benchmarks of mentioned above algorithms are gathered and compared between each other.
All data is stored at `Benchmarks` folder of current repository. Plots which reflect realtion `Array size - Alg. Execution Time` are stored at `Data Analysis` folder.

**Conclusion**: Fastest Search algorithm is `Binary Search`, Fastest data type is `Array`.
