We calculate all points from A
Iteration 1. Take Point A
Closest range from A to A is 0,
Fill table with zero
Mark A as visited
Include A to list of visited
Exclude A from list of unvisited
Get neighbors of A such that not visited
They are B and D
Distance D1 from A to B is 6
Distance D2 from A to D is 1
Are distances in table? not - add, yes - update if distance> actual
