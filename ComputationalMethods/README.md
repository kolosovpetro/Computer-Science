## Computational Methods

* Numerical Sys. Converter (Pure example how to break all SOLID rules in 1 class, **DO NOT WRITE CODE THIS WAY**)
* System of Linear Equations Solver
* Polynomial Interpolation (Vandermonde method)
* Discrete Integration (Simpson's, Trapezoidal methods)
* Monte Carlo Method (Estimation on the plan finishing time)
