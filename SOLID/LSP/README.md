## Liskov Substitution Principle

There always should be an opportunity to replace parent class by its child class without any program's functionality breaks.

### To maintain

- Preconditions must not be weaked in child class
- Postconditions must not be weaked in child class
- Invariants. All conditions of parent class must be saved in child class
