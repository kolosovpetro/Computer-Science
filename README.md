## Algorithms

Refer to https://kolosovpetro.github.io/cs/data_structures_and_algorithms/

* Search Algorithms (and their benchmark measurement)
  * Linear Searches
  * Binary Search
* Sort Algorithms
  * Bubble sort O(n^2)
  * Cocktail sort (Buble 2 pass sort) O(n^2)
  * Counting sort O(n+k), k = non negative terms count
  * Insertion sort O(n)
  * Merge sort O(n*log(n))
  * Quick sort O(log(n))
  * Selection sort O(n^2)
* Coin Change Problem (Intro to Dynamic programming)
* RPN Calculator (postfix calculator based on stack data structure)

## Data Structures

- Implemented data structures are
  - Dictionary
  - Graph
  - Heap
  - LinkedList
  - Queue
  - Stack
  - Tree
  - Weighted Graph
  - Binary Search Tree (in progress. See good visualization: http://btv.melezinek.cz/binary-search-tree.html)
  - Generic List (in progress)

- To be implemented in future
  - Priority Queue

- What's used
  - NUnit UnitTest Framework
  - Generics
  - Indexers
  - IEnumerable interface implementation

## Design Patterns

Refer to website: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns

* Creational
  * Factory Method (Extends functionality of program)
  * Abstract Factory
  * Builder (Avoiding huge number of parameters withing object's consturctor. Combination of parameters.)
  * Prototype (Deepcopy of class)
* Structural
  * Decorator (Combines required functionalities)
  * Bridge
* Behavioral
  * Observer (Defines interaction between two or more classes)
  * Strategy (Extends functionality of program)
  
## SOLID

A set of principles recommended to follow in order to maintain business applications. Contains examples of both convinient and unconviniet examples

* **Single Responsibility Principle** - `Do one thing, but do it best`
* **Open-Closed Principle** - `App. should be open for extension, but closed for modification`. Usually, solved by pattern `Strategy`
* **Liskov Substitution Principle** - `Proper abstractization, where all subclasses correctly implements methods from base class`
* **Interface Segregation Principle** - `Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.`
* **Dependency Inversion Principle**
  * `High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.`
  * `Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.`

## ADO .NET

Work in PostgreSQL data base through ADO .NET

Refer to https://kolosovpetro.github.io/cs/data_bases_2/01_NpgSQL.pdf

**Notes**

- Query which reterns data: `ExecuteReader()`
- DML DDL :`ExecuteNonQuery()`
- SQL injection protect: `Parameters.AddWithValue("param", var);`
- While using `Parameters` do not use place variable between `''`, eg dont do `'@var'`

## Git Simple Pull Request

Example of simple pull request and other related activities.

**Contains**

- Simple pull request guide
- How to untrack files from gitignore (apply gitignore file)
- How to keep forked repo up to date with remote

## Computational Methods

* Numerical Sys. Converter (Pure example how to break all SOLID rules in 1 class, **DO NOT WRITE CODE THIS WAY**)
* System of Linear Equations Solver
* Polynomial Interpolation (Vandermonde method)
* Discrete Integration (Simpson's, Trapezoidal methods)
* Monte Carlo Method (Estimation on the plan finishing time)

## Misc

Other projects.

* **Database Control Panel**. Simple winforms app in order to perform SQL queries on PostgreSQL Database. Not protected from SQL injections. 
* **LINQ**. A set of custom methods in order to operate over IEnumerable collections.

## To do list

- Unite all Data Structures under single library
- Write documentation and comments for Design Patterns
- For all design patterns generate class diagrams
- Write various extensions for IEnumerable, structs, classes
- Add README files to various projects
