### Decorator pattern

Decorator exposes the combined power of Aggregation and Inherritance.

Write a program in order to return the words: "White", "Red", "White", "Blue" in the order how user wants. 

For example: 
* Case 1: "White", "Red", "White", "Blue"
* Case 2: "White", "White", "Blue", "Red"
* Case 3: ...

Total posible combinations: 4! = 24. 

Do not write 24 different classes for any case.
