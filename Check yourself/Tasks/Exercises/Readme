This technical test contains a folder for each exercise category, each folder contains one or multiple exercises. 

Execution:
  -The "Dependencies" folder does not contain exercises - it only provides context.
  -Only files starting with "exercise" are to be edited.
  -Each exercise starts with a quick description of the issue at hand.
  -We do not expect the code to run.
  -Comments are appreciated.

Once you are done:
  -Delete bin, obj from the exercises folder.
  -Create a zip of the exercises folder.
  -Send the zip to kharder@betadwarf.com.

Happy coding!
